# Machine-Learning-Examples
Following the tutorials from https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples
Reading material from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

Implement these with a basic knowledge of Data Analytics and Machine Learning

1. Linear Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. kNN
4. Random Forests - Needs a fix
5. CNN 

Also read the awesome tutorial on backpropogation from the same book (Chap 2) and why it works so well for neural nets 

6. CNN with Abstraction using Tensorflow. - Needs a fix

Read what happens when the network has a slow learning rate due to the L2 cost function from chap 3 of the above book

a. Cross Entropy
b. SoftMax

Read about Regularization and why it works. Simple is better, but not neccesarily. 

a. Over Fitting
b. No Free Lunches

L1 Regularization - Makes the network smaller with lesser number of connections.
L2 Regularization - Makes sure the weights are not too big.
Dropout - Works similar to averaging multiple nets.

Data Augmentation - Makes the network more susceptible to changes

7. Convolution Neural Network (read chap 4)

8. Cat vs Dog - Tried an example using a vanilla CNN.

9. TensorBoard-Working - Example code for using tensorboard.
