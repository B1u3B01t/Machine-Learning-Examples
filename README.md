# Machine-Learning-Examples
Following the tutorials from [aymericdamien's Tensorflow Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples)

Reading material from [Neural Networks and deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

## 1: Implement these with a basic knowledge of Data Analytics and Machine Learning

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. kNN
4. Random Forests - Needs a fix
5. CNN

Also read the awesome tutorial on backpropogation from the same book ([Chapter 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)) and why it works so well for neural nets

6. CNN with Abstraction using Tensorflow. - Needs a fix

## 2: Read what happens when the network has a slow learning rate due to the L2 cost function from [Chapter 3](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html)

a. Cross Entropy
b. SoftMax

## 3: Read about [Regularization](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#regularization) and why it works. Simple is better, but not neccesarily.

a. Over Fitting
b. No Free Lunches

L1 Regularization - Makes the network smaller with lesser number of connections.
L2 Regularization - Makes sure the weights are not too big.
Dropout - Works similar to averaging multiple nets.

Data Augmentation - Makes the network more susceptible to changes

7. Convolution Neural Network (read chap 4)

8. Cat vs Dog - Tried an example using a vanilla CNN.

9. TensorBoard-Working - Example code for using tensorboard.

10. RNN(LSTM) - The timesteps are added to the LSTM cell.
